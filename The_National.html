    <!-- History -->
    <h1>Brief History of The National</h1>
    The National is a quintet of Cincinatti, OH natives who were living in NYC in the 2000s. Since 2001, The National have released <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_discography">8 studio albums</a>, which have garnered increasing critical acclaim.
    Their breakthrough album <em>Alligator</em> was releaed in 2005, one year before Taylor Swift's self-titled debut. 
    <p>
        The music of the national is regularly described as 'melancholic,' 'anxious,' and 'existential'- adjectives that you would not regularly ascribe to Taylor Swift. 
        <em> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/05/national-i-am-easy-find-album-review-sad-love/589597/">The Atlantic</a></em> recently described them as "arguably the band of this millennium to most consistently balance gut impact and brainy appeal, usually garnish their wallowing with a dignified strut." 
        Therefore, it can come as somewhat of a suprise that Taylor considers them her <a href="https://musicfeeds.com.au/news/taylor-swift-says-the-national-is-her-favourite-band/">"favorite band."</a>
    </p>
   
    <p>
        <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The National features two pairs of twins: the Dessners (Aaron & Bryce) and the Devendorfs (Bryan & Scott).
