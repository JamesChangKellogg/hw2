    <!-- Introducing my business-->
    <h1>About The National Consultants</h1>
    Welcome to <strong>The National Consultants.</strong>
    I provide custom, advisory services to <strong>Taylor Swift fans</strong> who want to learn more about <strong>The National</strong>, one of the iconic rock groups of the 21st century.

    <!-- Background - including links to Wikipedia pages -->
    <h2>Why we exist</h2>
    In 2020, legendary pop musician Taylor Swift released two 'surprise' albums: 
    <em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore_(Taylor_Swift_album)">Folkore </a></em> and 
    <em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evermore_(Taylor_Swift_album)">Evermore </a></em>.
    
    <p> 
    Both albums featured songs produced 'in secrecy' by 
    <strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Dessner">Aaron Dessner</a></strong>, composer and multi-instrumentalist for <em>The National</em>. 
    For many Swifties, the work of The National may have been previously unknown, and I want to help them explore their rich discography.
    </p>
    
    <!-- Website navigation with links -->
    <h3>My offerings</h3>
    To help explorers get started, my website features:
    <ul> 
        <li> <a href="The_National.html">A primer about The National</a> </li>
        <li> <a href="Recommendations.html">Recommendations about albums and merchandise </a> </li>
    </ul>

    I also offer personal coaching to explore the merits of specific National albums, songs, collaborations and their relevance to the Taylor Swift extended universe. These perspectives are worth paying significant dollars for because what is life without a deep devotion to The National.

    <!-- About me -->
    <h2>About me</h2>
    My name is James Chang, and when I am not a full-time MBA student at the Kellogg School of Management, I am a full-time student of The National. I also stan Taylor Swift, whose bandwagon I joined after her <em>1989</em> album. 
    <p>
        The collision of these two interests absolutely <em><strong>blew my mind</strong></em> and was one of the few bright spots in the 2020 cultural conversation. 
        The National Consultants provide the services you need to navigate that conversation with confidence and precision.
